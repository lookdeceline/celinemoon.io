                  My mission is to build the most seamless user experiences by applying sensing technologies to recognize user context through wearable devices.
                  Particularly, I can thrive when I solve a user-centered problem, by mixing different sensors and sensing technologies.

                  <br/><br/>
                  My dual-background in Computer Science and Fashion helps me understand the wearable technology from both the engineering and the human-centered design point of view. 
                  
                  <br/><br/>
                  I have always been interested in both the academic and industrial settings in building wearable applications. 
                  To experience the both worlds, I have worked as a research assistant at a Human-centered Computer Systems Lab, worked as a research engineer at LG Electronics‚Äô IoT Technologies Group, 
                  and am currently working as a software engineer at a Silicon Valley startup.

                  <br/><br/>
                  On the side lines, I have a huge love for delightful user interface designs. 
                  Particularly, I love both watching and implementing beautiful layers of charts. 
                  I am currently working on open-source project on Mobile visualization library for Swift.
