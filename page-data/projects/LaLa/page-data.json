A qualitative user study \nrevealed the following:\n\n* **Pain Point 1**  The position in which users write diaries is not comfortable.\n    * user A) “I want to write my diary at the end of the day in my most comfortable position. Like \nwrite while rolling around in bed, maybe.”\n    * user B) “I usually type in my diary app on my iPhone while in my bed, but my arms ache after a \nwhile, cause I have to hold them up high in the air if I want ro type fast.”\n    * user C) “/ like to write with my iPad, but that also means I have to be sitting at my desk to do \nit. Sometimes keep my diary See/s like another set of /a6or.”\n\n* **Pain Point 2**  The length of diaries and the visual interface of diaries app often makes long \nwritings become messy.\n    * user D) “Keeping diary lets me record the flow of my thoughts, but at the same time it‘s tough to \nkeep fhe records organ/zed. Like when I want to look back through what I wrote, I remember writing \nsomething down, but I can't find where I wrote it. It's a real bummer.”\n\n\n#### Key Insights For UX Design\nFrom the preliminary user study, I could notice that users wanted a way to write in a more \ncomfortable position. They also wanted to easily write down their thoughts, but in a way that keeps \nthem visually organized.\n\nAs a solution, I integrated voice interaction as a replacement to typing a keyboard or wrtiting \nwith a digital pen. To keep the user interface appear visually organized, I created a diary list in \na thread-like format that manages the structure of writings to stay sorted out.\n\nIn a nutshell, I designed the app to provide a structured interface that users can write into by \nspeaking into the app.\n -->\n<h3>User Interface Design</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"projectImage\" style=\"width: 680px;
