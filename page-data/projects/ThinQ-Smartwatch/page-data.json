This is because a smartwatch is designed to induce quick, on-the-fly user interactions, whereas a smartphone is designed for more complicated interactions.\n\n### System Architecture\nThe system pipeline for tracking user context and monitoring home appliance state is visualized in the below figure. Most of the system’s logic runs in the background state, except for when the prior notification is triggered. We also optimized the system by triggering activity recognition and networking to a cloud server only when a major location change is detected.\n\n<div class=\"projectImage\" style=\"width:100%; margin: 0px auto;\">\n    <img src=\"./sys-arch.jpg\">\n</div>\n\n### Final Output, Impacts\nThese are the screens of ThinQ on Apple Watch. \n<div class=\"projectImage\" style=\"width:88%; margin: 30px auto;\">\n    <img src=\"./output.jpg\">\n</div>\n\nImplicit interactions enable seamless experience; it is less explicit on the surface, but much more essential for more pervasive computing.\n\nAt the end of the project, I was given a chance to present this prototype to LG Electronics IoT Technologies Group. \nI was able to successfully convince the leadership to kickstart the ThinQ service for smartwatches. \nThe project is under progress.\n\n<div class=\"projectImage\" style=\"width:67%; margin: 30px auto;\">\n    <img src=\"./presenting.png\">\n</div>\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"ThinQ for Smartwatch","date":"03 January, 2021","intro":"An IoT application for smartwatches that sends push notifications based on the users' location and activity.","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6528925619834711,"src":"/static/3b59e334bd21b4ee250f1a08ba111795/2f1b1/thinq-featured8.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3b59e334bd21b4ee250f1a08ba111795/fd013/thinq-featured8.jpg 200w,\n/static/3b59e334bd21b4ee250f1a08ba111795/25252/thinq-featured8.jpg 400w,\n/static/3b59e334bd21b4ee250f1a08ba111795/2f1b1/thinq-featured8.jpg 800w,\n/static/3b59e334bd21b4ee250f1a08ba111795/0ff54/thinq-featured8.jpg 1200w,\n/static/3b59e334bd21b4ee250f1a08ba111795/06655/thinq-featured8.jpg 1600w,\n/static/3b59e334bd21b4ee250f1a08ba111795/be24b/thinq-featured8.jpg 1851w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"backgroundColor":"#F2F7F7","tags":null,"type":"app","text":"COMPANY WORK"}},"mdx":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/ThinQ/thinq/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3159585216"]}
